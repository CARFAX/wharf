# foo

This library can be installed via bower, for browser use

    bower install foo-js

And npm, for use in Node applications, or with Browserify

    npm install foo-js

To include the code, either

    var foo = require('foo-js')

or

```html
<script src='bower_components/foo-js/dist/foo.js'></script>
```

From that point on, everything in this library will be accessible via the foo object.
