# fu

This library can be installed via bower, for browser use

    bower install fu-js

And npm, for use in Node applications, or with Browserify

    npm install fu-js

To include the code, either

    var fu = require('fu-js')

or

```html
<script src='bower_components/fu-js/dist/fu.js'></script>
```

From that point on, everything in this library will be accessible via the fu object.
